A Pebble Watch Icon Pack

The icons are 15x15 b/w, designed for the First Pebble ActionBar
I'll soon add some more icons for the other platform
I've followed the Android Icon Pack guidelines for material design, since wants the most simple layout for its icon and with a 15x15 icon resolution you have to stay simple.

General tips
    It's better to draw horizontal and vertical lines only
    When a diagonal is necessary, use it at 45 degrees for a better layout
    Never trace a line too thin, at least 3pt of thickness
    For intersecting lines leave some space between them
